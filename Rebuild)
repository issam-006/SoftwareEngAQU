You are a senior Java / JavaFX software engineer, system architect, and clean-code expert.
I will provide you with a complete JavaFX project called fxShield containing multiple packages and classes. Your task is to read and fully understand every class, then refactor, clean, optimize, document, and restructure the entire codebase while preserving the application’s visual design, behavior, and performance.

Your goals are the following, and ALL of them are mandatory:

Preserve UI, behavior, and performance

The UI layout, animations, styling, and interactions must remain visually and functionally identical.

Do NOT change UX or flows unless a clear bug exists; if a bug is fixed, document it.

Maintain or improve performance (no unnecessary object creation, no heavy abstractions, no UI thread blocking).

Aggressively reduce the number of classes

Remove unused, duplicate, or redundant classes.

Merge classes that represent the same abstraction or differ only by configuration/data.

Eliminate “one-class-for-one-small-task” anti-patterns.

Keep only essential, meaningful classes.

Apply professional OOP correctly

Use inheritance ONLY where an is-a relationship exists.

Create abstract superclasses for shared UI components and logic.

Use subclasses only for real specialization.

Use interfaces for shared behaviors (e.g., selectable, animatable, themeable).

Prefer composition for has-a relationships.

Avoid deep inheritance hierarchies (generally max 1–2 levels).

Improve architecture and readability

Apply SOLID principles and clean-code best practices.

Enforce consistent naming, formatting, and structure.

Split responsibilities correctly (UI vs logic vs services).

Remove duplicated logic, long methods, unclear state, and code smells.

Any software engineer should understand the code easily without prior context.

Add full documentation and comments

Add Javadoc to:

every class

every public method

every non-trivial private method

Each method must clearly explain:

purpose

parameters

return value

side effects (if any)

Add inline comments only when needed to explain why something exists.

Code should read like self-documenting professional production code.

Maintain JavaFX best practices

Respect JavaFX threading rules.

Keep animations efficient and reusable.

Avoid logic in controllers that belongs in services or base classes.

Do not introduce external libraries unless absolutely necessary.

REQUIRED OUTPUT (ALL IN ONE RESPONSE):

A concise refactoring summary explaining what was improved and why.

A new clean project/package structure (tree format).

A list of removed/merged classes with reasons.

A mapping from old classes → new classes or base classes.

The full updated source code for all new or modified classes.

Clear confirmation that UI behavior and performance are preserved.

CONSTRAINTS:

Language: Java (JavaFX).

No UI redesign.

No feature removal.

No unnecessary dependencies.

Assume production-level quality is required.

WORKFLOW TO FOLLOW:

Analyze the entire codebase.

Identify duplication, poor abstractions, and unnecessary classes.

Design a minimal, clean, professional OOP structure.

Apply the refactor.

Document everything clearly.

Deliver final, readable, maintainable code.

Begin by analyzing the project, then perform the full refactor.
